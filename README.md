# Artificial Neural Netoworks and Deep Learning: Jeopardy! Edition
This project was completed by Alana Fiordalisi as a final project for the Arificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
course taught at DIS: Copenhagen in Spring 2020. The project spans two parts: a neural network that predicts
the difficulty of Jeopardy! questions, and a neural network that generates novel Jeopardy! questions.

A summary of the project, including an explanation of the structure, results, and next steps can be found
